# geometry-custom-theme

![example](example.png)

A slight variation the wonderful [zsh geometry](https://github.com/fribmendes/geometry) theme. I added a small underline between commands (like the `af-magic` theme).

## Installation

1. Install [geometry](https://github.com/fribmendes/geometry)
2. Replace the `geometry.zsh` file with the one in this repository (file at `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/geometry/geometry.zsh`)
